# Nunu — A CLI tool for building Go applications.

Nunu is a scaffolding tool for building Go applications. Its name comes from a game character in League of Legends, a little boy riding on the shoulders of a Yeti. Just like Nunu, this project stands on the shoulders of giants, as it is built upon a combination of popular libraries from the Go ecosystem. This combination allows you to quickly build efficient and reliable applications.

🚀Tips: This project is very complete, so updates will not be very frequent, welcome to use.

## Concise Layered Architecture
Nunu adopts a classic layered architecture. In order to achieve modularity and decoupling, it uses the dependency injection framework `Wire`.

```

The project architecture follows a typical layered structure, consisting of the following modules:

* `cmd`: This module contains the entry points of the application, which perform different operations based on different commands, such as starting the server or executing database migrations. Each sub-module has a `main.go` file as the entry file, as well as `wire.go` and `wire_gen.go` files for dependency injection.
* `config`: This module contains the configuration files for the application, providing different configurations for different environments, such as development and production.
* `deploy`: This module is used for deploying the application and includes deployment scripts and configuration files.
* `internal`: This module is the core module of the application and contains the implementation of various business logic.

  - `handler`: This sub-module contains the handlers for handling HTTP requests, responsible for receiving requests and invoking the corresponding services for processing.

  - `job`: This sub-module contains the logic for background tasks.

  - `model`: This sub-module contains the definition of data models.

  - `repository`: This sub-module contains the implementation of the data access layer, responsible for interacting with the database.

  - `server`: This sub-module contains the implementation of the HTTP server.

  - `service`: This sub-module contains the implementation of the business logic, responsible for handling specific business operations.

* `pkg`: This module contains some common utilities and functions.

* `scripts`: This module contains some script files used for project build, test, and deployment operations.

* `storage`: This module is used for storing files or other static resources.

* `test`: This module contains the unit tests for various modules, organized into sub-directories based on modules.

* `web`: This module contains the frontend-related files, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In addition, there are some other files and directories, such as license files, build files, and README. Overall, the project architecture is clear, with clear responsibilities for each module, making it easy to understand and maintain.

## Requirements
To use Nunu, you need to have the following software installed on your system:

* Go 1.19 or higher
* Git
* Docker (optional)
* MySQL 5.7 or higher (optional)
* Redis (optional)

### Installation

You can install Nunu with the following command:

```bash
go install github.com/go-nunu/nunu@latest
```

> Tips: If `go install` succeeds but the `nunu` command is not recognized, it is because the environment variable is not configured. You can add the GOBIN directory to the environment variable.

### Create a New Project

You can create a new Go project with the following command:

```bash
nunu new projectName
```

By default, it pulls from the GitHub source, but you can also use an accelerated repository in China:

```
// Use the basic template
nunu new projectName -r https://gitee.com/go-nunu/nunu-layout-basic.git
// Use the advanced template
nunu new projectName -r https://gitee.com/go-nunu/nunu-layout-advanced.git
```

This command will create a directory named `projectName` and generate an elegant Go project structure within it.

### Create Components

You can create handlers, services, repositories, and models for your project using the following commands:

```bash
nunu create handler user
nunu create service user
nunu create repository user
nunu create model user
```
or
```
nunu create all user
```

These commands will create components named `UserHandler`, `UserService`, `UserRepository`, and `UserModel`, respectively, and place them in the correct directories.

### Run the Project

You can quickly run the project with the following command:

```bash
nunu run
```

This command will start your Go project and support hot-reloading when files are updated.

### Compile wire.go

You can quickly compile `wire.go` with the following command:

```bash
nunu wire
```

This command will compile your `wire.go` file and generate the required dependencies.
